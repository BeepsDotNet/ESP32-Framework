  ## Version 2.3 Technical Implementation

  ### Enhanced User Experience Features (LATEST ADDITION)
  - **Move Messages**: "White, it is your move." / "Black is thinking..." display
  - **AI Thinking Animation**: Spinning circular arrows (⟳) during AI processing
  - **Human-like Timing**: Random delays (1.5-4 seconds) to prevent jarring instant responses
  - **Smooth Flow**: User move → AI thinking display → delay → AI move → back to user

  ### Complete Move Processing System
  - **Server-side**: Full `/api/move` endpoint with `handleUserMove()`, `applyMoveToBoard()`, and enhanced
   `parseMove()`
  - **Client-side**: Enhanced `attemptMove()` function with UX flow management
  - **Board Updates**: Pieces move on server board state with visual refresh and message updates
  - **Move Formats**: Supports coordinate (`6,4,4,4`), full algebraic (`e2e4`), and standard algebraic
  (`d5`, `Nc6`, `O-O`)
  - **Error Handling**: Server validation with client-side error display

  ### AI Integration (Fixed and Enhanced)
  - **Move Parsing**: Enhanced to handle all chess notation formats (algebraic, coordinate, castling)
  - **Fallback System**: Multiple backup moves prevent getting stuck on invalid moves
  - **Offline Mode**: Pre-determined moves for system stability      
  - **Response Flow**: Automatic AI responses after user moves with realistic timing

  ### Fullscreen Design with Enhanced UX
  - **Modern Interface**: Clean, fullscreen layout with dark theme (#1a1a1a background)
  - **Move Message Display**: Prominent green-bordered message box showing current turn and AI status
  - **Top Button Bar**: New Game, Reset, Undo, Redo, Pause, Resume, Save, Load, Refresh buttons
  - **Centered Chess Board**: 80vmin size with CSS Grid layout, green border glow effect
  - **Mobile Responsive**: Adaptive design for different screen sizes
  - **Status Display**: Real-time game status in top-right corner    

  ### Chess Board System
  - **Board State**: 8x8 `currentBoard[row][col]` array with piece codes and turn tracking (`isWhiteTurn`)
  - **Piece Notation**: "wp" = white pawn, "bn" = black knight, etc. 
  - **Visual Style**: Black (#000000) and dark grey (#404040) squares with perfect aspect ratio
  - **Piece Enhancement**: CSS filters for brightness/contrast optimization
  - **Board Rendering**: JavaScript-driven dynamic generation via `/api/board`

  ### Complete Drag & Drop System (WORKING)
  - **Drag Events**: `handleDragStart()`, `handleDragOver()`, `handleDrop()`
  - **Drop Zones**: All squares accept drops with proper `preventDefault()`
  - **Visual Feedback**: Smooth dragging without "not allowed" cursor
  - **Game State**: Tracks `draggedPiece` and `aiThinking` during operations
  - **Move Flow**: Drag → Drop → `attemptMove()` → UX messages → Server → AI response → Board Update

  ### Web Interface Technology (v2.3)
  - **Server**: AsyncWebServer on ESP32 with complete API structure  
  - **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with enhanced UX elements 
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/board` - Returns JSON board state
    - `GET /api/status` - Returns game status and current player     
    - `POST /api/newgame` - Starts new game
    - `POST /api/reset` - Resets current game
    - `POST /api/move` - **FULLY ENHANCED** - Processes moves with AI response and UX flow
  - **Real-time Updates**: JavaScript polling with message synchronization
  - **UX Features**: Move messages, thinking animations, random delays

  ### Current Architecture Status
  - **WebInterface.cpp**: Complete with enhanced UX, move processing, AI integration, and message
  management
  - **Move Handling**: Full support for all chess notation formats   
  - **AI Response**: Automatic responses with human-like timing and visual feedback
  - **Board Synchronization**: Server board state updates with enhanced visual refresh
  - **Debug Integration**: Comprehensive logging for all move and UX operations

  ## Development Workflow
  ### Standard Commands
  ```bash
  # Compile only
  cd "E:\Chess Ai vs Ai" && pio run

  # Upload firmware (automatically kills monitors if needed)
  cd "E:\Chess Ai vs Ai" && pio run --target upload --upload-port COM6

  # Serial monitor (background)
  cd "E:\Chess Ai vs Ai" && pio device monitor --port COM6 --baud 115200

  Critical Requirements

  - Serial Port Management: Must kill monitor sessions before uploading
  - Browser Cache: May need Ctrl+F5 after firmware updates for JavaScript changes
  - Git Branch: Currently on v2.3 branch for active development      
  - Version Matching: Web interface displays "Chess AI v2.3" matching git branch
