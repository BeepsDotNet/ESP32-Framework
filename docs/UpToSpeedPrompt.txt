Create a prompt that i can feed back into a fresh chat session which will bring the new chat session up to speed as to what the project is, the files involved, the hardware environment, the software environment. After submitting this prompt, I should be able to submit prompts as if we are just continuing where we left off, and will not require any fundamental questions needed to understand the current state of this project. Always match the git branch version number to the "Chess AI v#.#" displayed on the screen. Store the generated prompt into the docs subdirectory as the file Restore.MD.
