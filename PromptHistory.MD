# Prompt History - Chess AI v4.9

## Session Prompts (v4.9)

1. "to overcome the limitations of a one game per token we need to change the API Token to a Lichess BOT Api token. read file: Changing over to use a lichess BOT Api Token from a Persional API Token.md and give me your analysis."

2. "if we wanted to support more than 3 users say 10, I know the esp32 does not have enough ram to do this, but wouldn't it be possible to store some of the session data on the SQ Card in a directory called SessionData, and just pull in from the SD Card when a user makes a request."

3. "so given this new architecture approach many more users than 10 could be supported simultaneously, So if we have 6MB of disk space, how many theoretical simultaneous users could be active?"

4. "about how much memory/disk space is needed to encompass a session?"

5. "is it possible for you to invoke notepad.exe on the windows machine automatically to view the file?"

6. "yes"

7. "so did you incorporate the notepad.exe into the view log command?"

8. "yes"

9. "view log"

10. "no it does not, [showing truncated output]"

11. "i want to view the complete log file contents on the screen so i can see it."

12. "is it possible for you to invoke notepad.exe on the windows machine automatically to view the file?"

13. "yes"

14. "view log" (multiple times)

15. "the view log command has a restriction that it is limited on how many lines can be displayed based on the size of the log file on the SD Card. In order to remove this limit the View Log command needs to use a chunked approach so that larger files can be completely read."

16. "view log doesnt show the last lines in the log file, but the system seems hung up, in that if i open a new browser window on the ipad and click on New Game, a new game is never created. Please look at the log toward the bottom."

17. "I think there are more lines in the log because view log shows: ... [1725 lines truncated] ..."

18. "why cant we code something that will fix this without rebooting?"

19. "yes, but at this point the user is in the middle of a game and wants to resume right before the timeout occured."

20. "do we still need the reset button anymore?"

21. "yes put in admin buttons. Shoud the Resign button automatically call the code that the Reset Button does?"

22. "append a spinner to any message that is waiting for a response from lichess.com, ie while new game is being created, etc."

23. "do not show a confirmation dialog box when the Reset button is clicked. Just proceed."

24. "disable the New Game button when a game is active. It only be enabled, when it is ok to start a new game."

25. "uploaded new firmware, pc browser brought up app successfully, Pressed New Game, Black is Thinking... message still shows more than 30 seconds, and is still showing. view log to see it."

26. "Black is thinking... never timing out. view log to see."

27. "no need to upload html?"

28. "the New Game button is not disabled and a game is active."

29. "clicked ok, but new game button is not disabled."

30. "the New Game button is disabled because when i click on it nothing happens. Please gray out the button also."

31. "view commands"

32. "please remove blank line between commands but keep indentation. Update this in CLAUDE.md"

33. "view commands"

34. "create summary"

35. "new branch"

## Session Prompts (v5.0)

1. "new branch" (requested v5.0 instead of v4.10)

2. "upload html"

3. "version should be 5.0"

4. "no, browser shoes 4.9"

5. "i did not have to reboot the esp32 and 5.0 now displays. How did you miss this change?"

6. "please update CLAUDE.md so this wont happen again."

7. "come up with a way that the version number is defined only once, so that this problem wont exist."

8. "ok look at image chessboard.jpg. notice the square id's in the top right corner of the chessboard. please implement this nubmering system into our system. add a button "Labels" that when clicked toggles between showing the square id's and not showing the Square IDs"

9. "clicked labels button, nothing happened."

10. "view the log"

11. "works"

12. "view commands"

13. "create summary"

14. "new branch"

## Session Prompts (v5.1)

1. "analyze and tell me if it is possible when it is whites turn to move, when a chess piece is clicked on chessboard squares that would be a possible legal move for the selected piece would turn a different color to give feedback to the user. When the piece is deselected the chessboard squares return to their normal state."

2. "could it be implemented to work with black pieces as well even though it is whites turn to move?"

3. "implement option 1, and also add a button "Moves" to toggle this feature on or off, default off."

4. "upload html"

5. "instead of highlighting the whole square when showing legal moves just place a filled yellog circle with a black 1px outline in the middle of the square."

6. "yes"

7. "view the log, when i rebooted a dialog box asked to continue game or not. I thought we stopped this from happening. I then clicked on Reset, New Game"

8. "the problem is what if there are mulltiple browsers open at the same time. what then?"

9. "i am jumping ahead too far. I am thinking in the future we will use a BOT token which will allow multiple browsers each with its own unique game running."

10. "1"

11. "upload html"

12. "view log run away messages at bottom"

13. "upload html"

14. "tried to create a new game, message said "Error: Session already has active game: NuzHKxPT", tried to move white and message said "Start a new game first"."

15. "yes, but reset is only available on an admin authorized browser."

16. "2"

17. "upload html"

18. "view the log, runaway cleaning up previous game messages"

19. "yes"

20. "since a non admin browser cant click on the Reset button, just call it directly without having user intervention."

21. "y"

22. "black queen selected but yellog circles do not appear."

23. "you should be able to see it is green"

24. "and look at the log."

25. "still did not work."

26. "look at [Image #1] closer. New Game is disabled implying a game is active."

27. "the white piece highlighting has always worked, it is the black pieces that dont work."

28. "see file console.log"

29. "no way. I never manually merged these together! Maybe we should look back to other previous branches to find when this was working. I would never take all the manual time to merge two different log files into one log file!!!"

30. "i want to add a rule to CLAUDE.md so this problem does not occur again. can you do that?"

31. "great, in all the excitement i forgot, do we need to upload html?"

32. "view the log, it works!"

33. "please find out why the browser console messages are not showing up in the combined debug log."

34. "i know we had this working before?"

35. "in the console.log i shared earlier are serial log messages in that file too?"

36. "create summary"

37. "new branch"

## Session Prompts (v5.2)

1. "after a successful FEN button press put the link to the lichess app so i can click on it?"

2. "works on ipad too! Good work!"

3. "i wish i could go the other way, pasting a fen string into our app"

4. "i notice we pass the fen back and forth between esp32 and lichess. what would happen if we passed a completely different fen in the middle of a game? Most likely it would come back with illegal move, but it would be interesting to see what would happen?"

5. "oh well, i am always looking for a hole!"

6. "can a tab in a browser see information in a different tab?"

7. "right now there are two open tabs, one is our esp32 app and the other is the lichess analysis board."

8. "would it be possible to use curl to access the lichess analysis board since it doesnt seem to require a signin to use?"

9. "so couldnt curl access the dom and inside html?"

10. "way back in the past i wrote a php program that used curl to access a website, but i needed to see the inner html that was contained in the dom. I was able to access it after i used curl first. I could probably find it somewhere but it would take me a while."

11. "i think i used option 2. I would find the ajax calls in the javascript and call them directly to get the data."

12. "how can a large engine "Stockfish" run locally in a browser?"

13. "humm, so why am i using lichess to play against stockfish when it could already running in my browser?"

14. "yes, lets explore switching to local stockfish, although we have been running stockfish locally all along!"

15. "i thought you said stockfish was running in our local broswer not on lichess servers?"

16. "no problem! Yes i would like to try this, but before we do i want to create summary and new branch so if we get to a point it becomes aparent it is not the right direction to go, we can come right back to V5.2 if needed."

## v5.3 Session - Stockfish Migration & localStorage Game Persistence

1. [Continuation from previous context - Stockfish integration partially complete]

2. "firmware compiled and uploaded.did remaining steps and it works!!! Great job!!!"

3. "view log"

4. "show commands"

5. "view log --open"

6. "i was playing a game early this morning (5 am), and left the browser up on my ipad. I never refreshed the browser but i woke up areound 7 am and wanted to keep playing the game, so i reenabled the ipad display, i could see my game was still up in the safari browser. When i selected it to bring it into the foreground, the browser did a refresh which instantly killed my game. please analyse, see file: debug_log_20251007_082546.txt"

7. "yes" (to implementing localStorage save/restore)

8. "fantasiic!! works!"

9. "persists for 24 hours, please explain"

10. "i assume only one game is saved, never multiple games, correct?"

11. "single game save is perfect. I just wanted to know because of memory constraints."

12. "and this is 6k to 12k games stored in a local browser!"

13. "so does this make the applications capabilities as unlimited sessions?"

14. "❌ Does NOT let you resume someone else's game". might this be possible using wasm?"

15. "i am of the understanding that two separate browser instances con communicate with each other uing wasm sockets, so if the wasm code on each broswer "knew about each other" couldn't data be exchanges between the two?"

16. "read console.log and comment."

17. "no i just wanted your comments about what was in console.log. I looks like the esp32 would not have to be involved in communications between two browsers running a wasm code module in the background. correct?"

18. "so it would be possible for two different browsers to play a chess game with each other?"

19. "yes" (to implementing WebRTC two-player chess)

20. "before we do that lets create a new branch, so create summary, new branch."

## v5.4 Session - UI Enhancements & Admin Toggle

1. "make the chessboard outline dark red"

2. "after a piece is moved, either white or black, temporarily change the starting and ending squares to a lighter color. This color scheme remains visible until the next move when the board is restored to 'normal colors'. Then the new move will show different starting and ending squares highlighted."

3. "make the highlighted squares have a shade of green added to them."

4. "create an undo move button."

5. "why not enable for last one move (my first move + engines response)? If you can then change undo to function this way."

6. "instead of using an authorization file and an ip address to determine an authorized admin user, for now create a button "Admin" to toggle the admin buttons on/off, default off."

7. "create summary, new branch to prepare for WebRTC P2P implementation."

## v5.5.1 Session - WebRTC Signaling Message Routing Fix

1. "read summary.md"

2. "view log. not working?"

3. "ok fix it."

4. "view log. did not work."

5. "still does not work."

6. "it worked. now create summary, new branch"

## v5.6 Session - Session Management System

1. "add a button for an active session called "Refresh Browser". this will tell the remote bworser to do a refresh, and when a new session is created for the refresh, the old session will be deleted."

2. "upload html"

3. "duplicate ip addresses showing up. see console.log"

4. "upload html"

5. "the esp32 crashed.!"

6. "yes" (add safety checks to session cleanup)

7. "upload html"

8. "add to summary.md"

9. "new branch"
